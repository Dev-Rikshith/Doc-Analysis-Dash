Selecting a doctor for a critical medical decision is akin to assembling a superhero team for a mission; the goal is to identify the most qualified individual. However, the challenge lies in the current lack of comprehensive information about doctors' expertise and track records, similar to searching for a needle in a haystack. Presently, patients often rely on limited data, such as word-of-mouth recommendations or sparse online reviews, resulting in decisions made without sufficient insight into a physician's capabilities.

**Abstract:**
Introducing DocInsight, our innovative solution to the challenge of accessing comprehensive information about doctors. Much like assembling a superhero team for a mission, selecting the right physician for medical decisions requires detailed insights into their background, surgical experience, patient reviews, and overall track record. With DocInsight, we aim to address this gap by creating a centralized database for doctors, providing patients with an easily accessible platform where they can find all essential details about doctors in one place. By offering transparency and convenience, our project transforms the process of choosing a doctor from a blindfolded endeavor into a well-informed decision-making process, akin to selecting a superhero with the precise skills for the task at hand. We firmly believe that DocInsight will not only enhance patient satisfaction but also foster better healthcare choices overall.

**Data Collection:**
The project involves collecting comprehensive data pertaining to doctors' professional backgrounds, encompassing their educational qualifications, specialization, description and years of experience in the field. Additionally, the endeavor entails compiling detailed records on the volume and types of surgeries performed by each doctor, facilitating a comprehensive assessment of their surgical expertise. For the demonstration we considered some data which is not real and we provided some random percentage for surgical outcome analysis and also for the graph on the number of patients treated. The surgical outcome analysis is calculated based on the features: Duration of surgery, Experience level of the doctor, type of surgery, success rate. These are collected from the hospitals. Furthermore, the project encompasses gathering patient feedback and ratings from diverse sources, thereby enabling an evaluation of the doctor's reputation and overall quality of care provided. Through meticulous data collection and analysis, the project aims to furnish users with the necessary insights to make informed decisions regarding their healthcare choices.
